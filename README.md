🪐 French astrophysicist, studying in Sweden,<br/>
I simulate Core-Collapse Supernovae on big computers.

☕ I develop mainly in C++, Fortran and Python. <br/> 
I like learning low level stuff, electronics, and consuming too much caffeine.

🖥 I spend my free time working on my own utility library and game engine, <br/>
learning computer graphics and numerical methods.
