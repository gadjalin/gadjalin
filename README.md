ðŸ”­ French astrophysicist, studied in Sweden, working in Germany<br/>
I study core-collapse supernovae, the implosive end of massive stars ðŸ’¥,<br/>
and use open-source code to simulate them!

â˜• I develop primarily in C/C++, Fortran and Python.<br/>
I like learning low level stuff, electronics, and having [fika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_culture#Sweden).

ðŸ–¥ I spend my free time working on my own utility libraries and game engine,<br/>
learning computer graphics and numerical methods.

ðŸŒ³ Sometimes I remember to go out and [touch grass](https://youtu.be/8UUoEUROvhQ).
